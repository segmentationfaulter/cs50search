Overview:

    This program aims to index and make searchable the subreddit for Harvard's cs50x 2014 course located at:

    http://www.reddit.com/r/cs50

    The idea behind the project is to make posts which have yet to be indexed by reddit or Google
    searchable in a way that services the requirements of its average user.
    
    This program is split into two main areas: The indexing and the searching

    - The indexing

        This section of the program aims to search for all posts in the /r/cs50 subreddit and
        create a list of all of the words used on that page.

        This list is then submitted to the server which stores the data in a database for use by the searching part of the program.

    - The searching

        The searching part of the program aims to interpret and present the data in the database in the most
        appropriate way, based on the user's search term

What the files are:

   - main.sh

        This file runs the indexing side of the program non-stop until interrupted

   - urlfinder.sh

        This script attempts to create a list of all of the urls which point to posts on the subreddit

   - textfinder.sh

        This script parses the source of all of the posts in the above list and submits the data to the server

   - cs50search_index.php

        This script receives the data from textfinder.sh and enters it into the database

   - cs50search.php

        This script provides the interface and data interpretation for the user.

How to get the php files on the server
